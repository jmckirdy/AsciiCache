		<b>THANK YOU FOR READING THE DISCLAIMER</b>

		<p>ASCIICache.jumpingcrab.com = ASCIICache (.com)</p>

		<p>We ask with all our hearts that you do not follow instructions or steps in any textfile on this site without consulting professionals in the field or established reference materials; some of these files have no basis in reality whatsoever, and should not be construed as appropriate for any purpose other than historical research.</p>

		<p>ASCIICache.com broaches a wide array of subjects, concepts, points of view, and writing styles. We ask that you respect the law in your jurisdiction regarding what texts are appropriate for you to access, and that if you are unsure as to your right to browse this site, that you leave this site immediately and consult your local law enforcement, facility supervisor, or caretakers. If you have any doubts about the nature of our content, we ask that you leave the site immediately. We stress that we do not have the facilities to ensure that our content is appropriate for everyone who browses our site and additionally, we cannot guarantee that all textfiles on this site are appropriately labelled or classified.</p>
		<p>It is the nature of this site that literately thousands and thousands of textfiles are being added, with only a cursory glance at the beginning of the files to create a one-line description before placing it online. In some cases, they are placed online with no human intervention whatsoever. Because of this, we ask for your assistance in helping us make more accurate descriptions, less doubled files, and, where justified, to request that we remove the file in question if it was mistakenly provided to us under false pretenses or was originally put online in a different, unmodified form.</p>

		<p>Our policy in terms of removal of textfiles from this site is to allow the creator/writers of the files to determine the fate of their own files. Requests to have files removed from the site will be granted, although we do reserve the right to notate that the file has been removed, so that other users will not waste our time and theirs trying to replace it. If the author has a more complete collection of their files and wishes to upload that collection to us, we will gladly replace the modified files with the originals.</p>

		<p>ASCIICache.com is strongly against censorship and will not remove files because of questions of taste, truthfulness, obsolesence, or need. We are not seeking to have the most up-to-date information on a given technical subject; we only wish to present how the subject was perceived by the BBS world, long before new features or corporate interest changed the subject. We actively pursue the opinions of the writers of these textfiles regarding the context in which they were originally created, and provide a historical essay section for the writers to pontificate about these contexts and facts. Again, we make no guarantees about the accuracy or truthfulness of these opinion-centric essays by textfile writers.</p>

		<p>Finally, ASCIICache.com maintains absolutely NO COPYRIGHT OR OWNERSHIP on any part of the site, including our own descriptions and introductions. ASCIICache as an organization is only interested in distribution of these texts, and makes no claim on them. We hope you enjoy the site, and that you will help to make it the best archive of these texts on the Internet.</p>
