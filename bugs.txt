feature: well u should scp down to Linux OS, then that's backup one prefferable on red stick.!!

*move backup to windows also, then do a giHub initial request. assaaapp!
**BONUS -because it will make development easier as u switch back to VS Code on Windows. 
*In near future practice VS Code env. setup on Linux Comp. too, since windowsComp is in bad shape.
(fyi) -Vim is kinda annoying compared to autocomplete extentions on VSCode.

**Print out the backed up code. and edit, with red pen then retype with indents removed.
